1. debts and payment_plan totals don't add up.
    - This causes the remaining_amount to potentially populate even though the customer completed the payment plan
    - Assuming payment_plans will not be higher than debts
    - Next payment due date will be null because there's no payment plan left

2. There is no direct link between payments and debts.
    - This goes back to point 1, but if there are partial amounts that aren't included on a payment plan - the debt has no way to be paid off.

3. /payment_plans and /payments endpoint responses don't line up with API specs (non-ISO)
